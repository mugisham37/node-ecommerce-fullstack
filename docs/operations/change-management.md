### 3. Implementation Planning

#### Pre-Implementation
```powershell
# Create implementation checklist
$changeId = "CR-2024-01-15-001"
$implementationDate = "2024-01-15"

# Verify prerequisites
./scripts/operations/health-check.ps1 -Detailed
./scripts/backup/full-system-backup.ps1

# Prepare rollback artifacts
git tag "pre-$changeId"
docker images | grep ecommerce > "rollback-images-$changeId.txt"
```

#### Implementation Window
1. **Start of Window**
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Verify system health
   - Begin implementation

2. **During Implementation**
   - Follow implementation steps exactly
   - Monitor system health continuously
   - Document any deviations

3. **Post-Implementation**
   - Verify functionality
   - Run smoke tests
   - Monitor for issues
   - Update documentation

#### Post-Implementation
```powershell
# Verify deployment success
./scripts/operations/health-check.ps1 -Detailed

# Run smoke tests
./scripts/testing/smoke-tests.ps1

# Monitor metrics
./scripts/monitoring/check-metrics.ps1 -Duration 30
```

## Deployment Windows

### Standard Maintenance Windows
- **Primary**: Tuesdays 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM UTC
- **Secondary**: Thursdays 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM UTC
- **Emergency**: Any time with proper approval

### Holiday and Blackout Periods
- **Code Freeze**: 2 weeks before major holidays
- **Blackout Periods**: Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Holiday shopping season
- **Restricted Changes**: Only P0 emergency changes during blackout periods

## Change Implementation Procedures

### Blue-Green Deployment
```powershell
# Standard blue-green deployment
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.ps1 -Version $version -Environment production

# Verification steps
1. Health check on new environment
2. Smoke tests execution
3. Traffic switch
4. Monitor for 30 minutes
5. Cleanup old environment
```

### Canary Deployment
```powershell
# Canary deployment for high-risk changes
./scripts/deployment/canary-deploy.ps1 -Version $version -InitialTrafficPercent 5

# Gradual traffic increase
- 5% for 30 minutes
- 25% for 30 minutes  
- 50% for 30 minutes
- 100% after validation
```

### Database Changes
```powershell
# Database migration process
1. Backup database
./scripts/database/backup.ps1

2. Test migration on staging
./scripts/database/migrate.ps1 -Environment staging -DryRun

3. Execute migration
./scripts/database/migrate.ps1 -Environment production

4. Verify data integrity
./scripts/database/verify-migration.ps1
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures after deployment
- Error rate exceeding 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time degradation > 50%
- Critical functionality failures

### Manual Rollback Process
```powershell
# Blue-green rollback
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.ps1 -Rollback

# Canary rollback
./scripts/deployment/canary-deploy.ps1 -Rollback

# Database rollback (if applicable)
./scripts/database/restore.ps1 -BackupFile "pre-change-backup.sql"
```

### Rollback Decision Matrix
| Issue Severity | Time to Investigate | Action |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| P0 - Critical | 0-5 minutes | Immediate rollback |
| P1 - High | 5-15 minutes | Investigate, rollback if no quick fix |
| P2 - Medium | 15-30 minutes | Investigate, consider rollback |
| P3 - Low | 30+ minutes | Investigate, fix forward |
