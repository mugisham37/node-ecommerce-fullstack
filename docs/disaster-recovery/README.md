# Disaster Recovery Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) strategy for the full-stack monolith architecture. The DR system is designed to ensure business continuity with minimal downtime and data loss in case of system failures or disasters.

## Architecture

### High Availability Components

- **Load Balancers**: Multi-zone NGINX load balancers with health checks
- **Database Cluster**: PostgreSQL cluster with streaming replication
- **Redis Cluster**: 6-node Redis cluster with automatic failover
- **Application Pods**: Multi-replica deployments with anti-affinity rules
- **Storage**: Replicated persistent volumes with automated backups

### Disaster Recovery Sites

1. **DR Site 1** (Primary DR)
   - Location: US West 2
   - Capacity: 100% of production
   - RTO: 15 minutes
   - RPO: 5 minutes

2. **DR Site 2** (Secondary DR)
   - Location: EU West 1
   - Capacity: 80% of production
   - RTO: 30 minutes
   - RPO: 15 minutes

3. **Cloud Backup** (Tertiary DR)
   - Location: Multi-region cloud
   - Capacity: 50% of production
   - RTO: 60 minutes
   - RPO: 30 minutes

## Recovery Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 15 minutes for critical systems
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 5 minutes maximum data loss
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year)

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Types

1. **Full System Backup**
   - Frequency: Weekly
   - Retention: 12 weeks
   - Components: All system components, configurations, and data

2. **Incremental Backup**
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Components: Changed data since last backup

3. **Transaction Log Backup**
   - Frequency: Every 15 minutes
   - Retention: 7 days
   - Components: Database transaction logs

### Backup Locations

- **Primary**: Local storage cluster
- **Secondary**: AWS S3 Glacier
- **Tertiary**: Azure Blob Storage (cold tier)

## Failover Procedures

### Automatic Failover

The system includes automated failover for:
- Database primary/replica switching
- Application pod redistribution
- Load balancer endpoint updates
- DNS failover to DR sites

### Manual Failover

For complex scenarios requiring human intervention:

1. **Assessment Phase** (5 minutes)
   - Evaluate system health
   - Determine failover scope
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Execution Phase** (10 minutes)
   - Execute failover scripts
   - Verify system functionality
   - Update monitoring systems

3. **Validation Phase** (5 minutes)
   - Confirm all services operational
   - Validate data integrity
   - Update status dashboards

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks

- **Database**: Connection tests, replication lag, query performance
- **Application**: HTTP health endpoints, response times, error rates
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network connectivity
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party service availability

### Alert Thresholds

| Component | Warning | Critical | Action |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Database Response Time | >2s | >5s | Auto-failover |
| API Error Rate | >5% | >10% | Auto-failover |
| Memory Usage | >80% | >90% | Scale up |
| Disk Usage | >85% | >95% | Cleanup/Scale |

## Testing and Validation

### DR Testing Schedule

- **Monthly**: Automated backup/restore tests
- **Quarterly**: Partial failover tests
- **Annually**: Full disaster recovery simulation

### Test Scenarios

1. **Database Failure**: Primary database becomes unavailable
2. **Application Failure**: All application pods crash
3. **Site Failure**: Entire data center becomes unavailable
4. **Network Partition**: Communication between sites is lost
5. **Data Corruption**: Database corruption detected

## Runbooks

### Emergency Contacts

- **Primary On-Call**: +1-555-0123
- **Secondary On-Call**: +1-555-0124
- **Management Escalation**: +1-555-0125
- **Vendor Support**: Available in vendor contact sheet

### Communication Plan

1. **Internal Notification**
   - Slack: #incident-response
   - Email: ops@company.com
   - Phone: Emergency contact list

2. **External Communication**
   - Status page updates
   - Customer notifications
   - Stakeholder briefings

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

```powershell
# Restore from backup
./scripts/disaster-recovery/restore-procedures.ps1 -BackupPath "path/to/backup" -RestoreType "database-only" -TargetEnvironment "production"

# Verify data integrity
./scripts/database/verify-integrity.ps1

# Update application connections
kubectl patch secret database-credentials -n production -p '{"data":{"url":"<new-db-url>"}}'
```

### Application Recovery

```powershell
# Deploy to DR site
kubectl config use-context dr-site-1
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/ha/application-deployment.yml

# Scale applications
kubectl scale deployment api-deployment --replicas=3 -n production
kubectl scale deployment web-deployment --replicas=3 -n production

# Verify health
kubectl get pods -n production
```

### Full System Recovery

```powershell
# Execute full system restore
./scripts/disaster-recovery/restore-procedures.ps1 -BackupPath "path/to/backup" -RestoreType "full" -TargetEnvironment "disaster-recovery"

# Validate all components
./scripts/disaster-recovery/validate-recovery.ps1

# Switch traffic to DR site
./scripts/disaster-recovery/switch-traffic.ps1 -TargetSite "dr-site-1"
```

## Security Considerations

### Backup Security

- All backups are encrypted using AES-256
- Encryption keys stored in secure key management system
- Access controls limit backup access to authorized personnel
- Regular security audits of backup systems

### Network Security

- VPN connections between DR sites
- Firewall rules restrict access to DR systems
- Network segmentation isolates DR traffic
- Regular penetration testing of DR infrastructure

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Requirements

- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Industry-specific regulations (if applicable)
- Regular compliance audits

### Documentation Requirements

- Incident response logs
- Recovery time tracking
- Data integrity validation
- Stakeholder communication records

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics and KPIs

- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
- Recovery Point Objective achievement
- Backup success rates
- Failover test results

### Review Process

- Monthly DR metrics review
- Quarterly procedure updates
- Annual strategy assessment
- Post-incident reviews and improvements
