# Vulnerability Management Policy

## Overview
This policy defines the process for identifying, assessing, and remediating security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Automated Scanning
- Weekly vulnerability scans of all systems
- Continuous monitoring of critical systems
- Authenticated scans for comprehensive coverage
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for code scanning

### Scan Coverage
- Network infrastructure
- Operating systems
- Applications and services
- Databases
- Container images
- Third-party dependencies

## Risk Assessment

### Vulnerability Scoring
- CVSS v3.1 scoring system
- Environmental scoring adjustments
- Business impact assessment
- Exploitability analysis

### Risk Categories
- **Critical**: CVSS 9.0-10.0, immediate remediation required
- **High**: CVSS 7.0-8.9, remediation within 7 days
- **Medium**: CVSS 4.0-6.9, remediation within 30 days
- **Low**: CVSS 0.1-3.9, remediation within 90 days

## Remediation Process

### Patch Management
- Emergency patching for critical vulnerabilities
- Regular patch cycles for non-critical updates
- Testing in staging environment before production
- Rollback procedures for failed patches

### Remediation Tracking
- Vulnerability database maintenance
- Remediation status tracking
- Exception handling process
- Regular reporting to management

## Third-Party Risk Management

### Vendor Assessment
- Security questionnaires for all vendors
- Regular security assessments
- Contract security requirements
- Vendor incident notification requirements

### Supply Chain Security
- Software composition analysis
- Open source vulnerability monitoring
- Dependency update management
- License compliance tracking

## Penetration Testing
- Annual external penetration testing
- Quarterly internal penetration testing
- Red team exercises for critical systems
- Bug bounty program for continuous testing

## Metrics and Reporting
- Mean time to detection (MTTD)
- Mean time to remediation (MTTR)
- Vulnerability aging reports
- Compliance dashboard
- Executive security scorecards
