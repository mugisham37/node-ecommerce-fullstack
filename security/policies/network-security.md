# Network Security Policy

## Overview
This policy defines network security requirements for production infrastructure.

## Network Architecture

### Network Segmentation
- DMZ for public-facing services
- Internal network for application servers
- Database network with restricted access
- Management network for administrative access
- Separate networks for development/staging/production

### Firewall Rules
- Default deny all traffic
- Explicit allow rules for required services
- Regular firewall rule reviews
- Automated rule deployment and rollback

## Access Controls

### VPN Requirements
- Site-to-site VPN for office connections
- Client VPN for remote worker access
- Multi-factor authentication for VPN access
- Split tunneling prohibited for production access

### Network Access Control (NAC)
- Device authentication before network access
- Certificate-based device identification
- Automatic quarantine for non-compliant devices
- Regular device compliance scanning

## Monitoring and Detection

### Network Monitoring
- 24/7 network traffic monitoring
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- DDoS protection and mitigation
- Network flow analysis

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Centralized log collection
- Real-time security event correlation
- Automated threat detection
- Incident alerting and escalation

## Wireless Security
- WPA3 encryption minimum
- Enterprise authentication (802.1X)
- Guest network isolation
- Regular wireless security assessments

## Cloud Network Security
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration
- Security groups and NACLs
- Private subnets for sensitive resources
- VPC flow logs enabled
- Transit gateway for multi-VPC connectivity

## Incident Response
- Network isolation procedures
- Traffic capture capabilities
- Forensic network analysis tools
- Communication channels during incidents
