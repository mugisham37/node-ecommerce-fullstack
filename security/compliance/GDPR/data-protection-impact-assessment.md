# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Template

## Overview
This template is used to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments as required by GDPR Article 35.

## When to Conduct a DPIA
A DPIA is required when processing is likely to result in high risk to individuals, particularly when:
- Systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects
- Processing special categories of data on a large scale
- Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale

## DPIA Process

### Step 1: Describe the Processing
**Processing Operation**: [Description of the processing activity]

**Data Controller**: [Organization name and contact details]

**Data Protection Officer**: [DPO name and contact details]

**Processing Purpose**: [Specific purposes for processing]

**Legal Basis**: [GDPR Article 6 legal basis]

### Step 2: Assess Necessity and Proportionality
**Necessity Assessment**:
- Is the processing necessary for the specified purpose?
- Could the purpose be achieved through less intrusive means?
- Is the processing proportionate to the purpose?

**Proportionality Assessment**:
- What is the impact on individuals?
- Are there less intrusive alternatives?
- What safeguards are in place?

### Step 3: Identify and Assess Risks
**Risk Categories**:
1. **Confidentiality Risks**: Unauthorized access or disclosure
2. **Integrity Risks**: Unauthorized modification or corruption
3. **Availability Risks**: Loss of access or destruction

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data breach | Medium | High | High | Encryption, access controls |
| Unauthorized access | Low | High | Medium | Multi-factor authentication |
| Data loss | Low | Medium | Low | Regular backups |

### Step 4: Identify Measures to Address Risks
**Technical Measures**:
- Encryption of personal data
- Pseudonymization where possible
- Access controls and authentication
- Regular security testing
- Data backup and recovery procedures

**Organizational Measures**:
- Staff training on data protection
- Data protection policies and procedures
- Regular compliance audits
- Incident response procedures
- Data retention and deletion policies

### Step 5: Consultation
**Internal Consultation**:
- IT Security Team
- Legal Department
- Business Stakeholders
- Data Protection Officer

**External Consultation** (if required):
- Data subjects (where appropriate)
- Supervisory authority (if high residual risk)

### Step 6: Document Outcomes
**DPIA Conclusion**:
- [ ] Processing can proceed as planned
- [ ] Processing can proceed with additional safeguards
- [ ] Processing should not proceed due to high residual risk

**Residual Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]

**Approved By**: [Name and title]
**Date**: [Date of approval]

## Monitoring and Review
- DPIA review date: [Date]
- Monitoring frequency: [Quarterly/Semi-annually/Annually]
- Review triggers: [Changes to processing, new risks identified, etc.]

## Documentation Requirements
- Keep records of all DPIAs conducted
- Make available to supervisory authority upon request
- Update when processing operations change significantly

## DPIA Register
Maintain a register of all DPIAs with:
- Processing operation name
- DPIA completion date
- Risk level assessment
- Review date
- Status (Active/Archived)
