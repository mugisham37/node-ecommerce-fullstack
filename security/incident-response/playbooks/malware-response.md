# Malware Incident Response Playbook

## Overview
This playbook provides procedures for responding to malware infections, including viruses, ransomware, trojans, and other malicious software.

## Immediate Response (0-30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Detection and Initial Assessment (0-5 minutes)
- [ ] **Confirm malware presence**: Verify detection through multiple sources
- [ ] **Identify affected systems**: Determine scope of infection
- [ ] **Document initial findings**: Record detection time, systems, and malware type
- [ ] **Alert incident response team**: Notify core team members

### Step 2: Immediate Containment (5-30 minutes)
- [ ] **Isolate infected systems**: Disconnect from network immediately
  - Unplug network cables
  - Disable Wi-Fi connections
  - Block at firewall level
- [ ] **Preserve evidence**: Take screenshots and memory dumps if possible
- [ ] **Stop lateral movement**: Monitor for signs of spreading
- [ ] **Activate backup systems**: Switch to clean backup systems if available

## Short-term Response (30 Minutes - 4 Hours)

### Step 3: Analysis and Investigation
- [ ] **Malware identification**: Determine malware family and variant
- [ ] **Impact assessment**: Evaluate damage and data compromise
- [ ] **Entry point analysis**: Identify how malware entered the system
- [ ] **Timeline reconstruction**: Build timeline of infection and spread

### Step 4: Extended Containment
- [ ] **Network segmentation**: Isolate affected network segments
- [ ] **Account security**: Reset credentials for potentially compromised accounts
- [ ] **Email security**: Block malicious email addresses and domains
- [ ] **Web filtering**: Block malicious URLs and IP addresses

## Medium-term Response (4-24 Hours)

### Step 5: Eradication
- [ ] **Malware removal**: Use appropriate anti-malware tools
- [ ] **System cleaning**: Remove malware artifacts and persistence mechanisms
- [ ] **Vulnerability patching**: Address vulnerabilities exploited by malware
- [ ] **Configuration hardening**: Implement additional security controls

### Step 6: Recovery Planning
- [ ] **System restoration**: Plan restoration from clean backups
- [ ] **Data recovery**: Assess data recovery needs and options
- [ ] **Service restoration**: Plan phased restoration of services
- [ ] **Monitoring enhancement**: Implement additional monitoring

## Malware-Specific Procedures

### Ransomware Response
- [ ] **DO NOT PAY RANSOM**: Paying does not guarantee data recovery
- [ ] **Isolate immediately**: Prevent encryption of additional files
- [ ] **Identify variant**: Determine ransomware family for potential decryptors
- [ ] **Check backups**: Verify backup integrity and isolation
- [ ] **Law enforcement**: Consider reporting to FBI/local authorities
- [ ] **Decryption tools**: Check for available free decryption tools

### Banking Trojan Response
- [ ] **Financial account security**: Immediately secure all financial accounts
- [ ] **Credential reset**: Change all banking and financial passwords
- [ ] **Transaction monitoring**: Monitor for unauthorized transactions
- [ ] **Certificate validation**: Check for compromised certificates
- [ ] **Browser security**: Clear browser data and check for malicious extensions

### APT/Targeted Attack Response
- [ ] **Threat intelligence**: Gather intelligence on threat actor
- [ ] **Forensic analysis**: Conduct detailed forensic investigation
- [ ] **IOC development**: Develop indicators of compromise
- [ ] **Threat hunting**: Hunt for additional compromised systems
- [ ] **Attribution analysis**: Attempt to identify threat actor

## Recovery and Restoration (1-7 Days)

### Step 7: System Recovery
- [ ] **Clean system rebuild**: Rebuild systems from known-clean state
- [ ] **Backup restoration**: Restore data from verified clean backups
- [ ] **Security validation**: Verify all security controls are operational
- [ ] **Monitoring deployment**: Deploy enhanced monitoring solutions

### Step 8: Service Restoration
- [ ] **Phased restoration**: Gradually restore services with monitoring
- [ ] **User communication**: Inform users of service restoration
- [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Monitor system performance post-recovery
- [ ] **Security testing**: Conduct security testing of restored systems

## Prevention and Hardening

### Technical Controls
- [ ] **Endpoint protection**: Deploy/update anti-malware solutions
- [ ] **Email security**: Implement advanced email filtering
- [ ] **Web filtering**: Deploy web content filtering
- [ ] **Application whitelisting**: Implement application control
- [ ] **Patch management**: Ensure all systems are patched
- [ ] **Backup security**: Secure and test backup systems

### Administrative Controls
- [ ] **User training**: Conduct security awareness training
- [ ] **Policy updates**: Update security policies and procedures
- [ ] **Access controls**: Review and restrict user privileges
- [ ] **Incident procedures**: Update incident response procedures
