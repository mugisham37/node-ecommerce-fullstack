### 3. Malware Incident
**Definition**: Detection or impact of malicious software

**Subcategories**:

- Banking trojans
- Advanced persistent threats (APT)
- Worms and viruses
- Cryptominers

**Examples**:
- Ransomware encrypting file servers
- Trojan stealing banking credentials

- Cryptomining malware consuming resources

### 4. Denial of Service
**Definition**: Attacks or incidents that disrupt service availability

**Subcategories**:
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Application-layer attacks
- Resource exhaustion
- Network flooding
- Service disruption

**Examples**:
- DDoS attack against web services
- Application crashes due to malformed requests
- Network congestion from attack traffic
- Database performance degradation from queries

### 5. Unauthorized Access
**Definition**: Access to systems or data without proper authorization

**Subcategories**:
- Account compromise
- Privilege escalation
- Insider threats
- Physical security breaches
- Social engineering

**Examples**:
- Compromised user accounts
- Unauthorized physical access to facilities
- Social engineering attacks against employees
- Abuse of legitimate access privileges

### 6. Policy Violations
**Definition**: Violations of security policies and procedures

**Subcategories**:
- Data handling violations
- Access control violations
- Software policy violations
- Communication policy violations
- Physical security violations

**Examples**:
- Unauthorized software installation
- Sharing credentials with unauthorized persons
- Improper data disposal
- Violation of acceptable use policies

## Severity Classification

### Critical (P1)
**Criteria**:

**Response Time**: 15 minutes
**Escalation**: Immediate executive notification
**Resources**: Full incident response team

**Examples**:
- Ransomware encrypting critical business systems
- Confirmed theft of customer payment data
- Complete network outage affecting all operations
- Active APT with data exfiltration

### High (P2)
**Criteria**:
- Suspected data breach requiring investigation
- Significant service degradation
- Malware on critical systems
- Compromise of privileged accounts
- Potential regulatory implications

**Response Time**: 30 minutes
**Escalation**: Management notification within 1 hour
**Resources**: Core incident response team

**Examples**:
- Malware detected on file servers
- Suspicious database access patterns
- Compromised administrator account
- Significant DDoS attack affecting services

### Medium (P3)
**Criteria**:
- Limited system compromise
- Minor service disruption
- Policy violations with security implications
- Suspicious activity requiring investigation
- Isolated malware infections

**Response Time**: 2 hours
**Escalation**: Supervisor notification within 4 hours
**Resources**: Security analyst and relevant technical staff

**Examples**:
- Malware on single endpoint
- Unauthorized access attempt (failed)
- Minor policy violation
- Suspicious network traffic

### Low (P4)
**Criteria**:
- Informational security events
- Minor policy violations
- Routine security alerts
- False positive investigations
- Security awareness issues

**Response Time**: 24 hours
**Escalation**: Routine reporting
**Resources**: Individual analyst

**Examples**:
- Failed login attempts within normal thresholds
- Minor software policy violations
- Routine vulnerability scan findings
- Security awareness training violations

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
**High Impact**:
- Revenue loss > $100,000
- Customer data compromised
- Regulatory fines likely
- Significant reputation damage
- Critical business processes disrupted

**Medium Impact**:
- Revenue loss $10,000 - $100,000
- Internal data compromised
- Potential regulatory scrutiny
- Moderate reputation impact
- Important business processes affected

**Low Impact**:
- Revenue loss < $10,000
- No sensitive data compromised
- Minimal regulatory concern
- Limited reputation impact
- Non-critical processes affected

### Technical Impact
**High Impact**:
- Multiple critical systems compromised
- Data integrity compromised
- Complete service outage
- Widespread malware infection
- Administrative access compromised

**Medium Impact**:
- Single critical system compromised
- Limited data integrity issues
- Partial service degradation
- Isolated malware infections
- User account compromises

**Low Impact**:
- Non-critical systems affected
- No data integrity issues
- Minimal service impact
- Single endpoint infections
- No account compromises

## Classification Matrix

| Category | Data Breach | System Compromise | Malware | DoS | Unauthorized Access | Policy Violation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| **Critical** | Confirmed sensitive data theft | Critical infrastructure compromise | Ransomware/APT | Complete service outage | Admin account compromise | Major compliance violation |
| **High** | Suspected data breach | Important system compromise | Banking trojan | Significant service impact | Privileged access | Security policy violation |
| **Medium** | Limited data exposure | Single system compromise | Endpoint malware | Minor service impact | User account compromise | Minor policy violation |
