# Backend Migration Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive migration and integration of functionality from a standalone e-commerce backend (other-backend) into our existing full-stack monorepo. The migration will ensure that no business logic, features, or capabilities are lost while properly integrating everything at the highest architectural level within our monorepo structure.

The other-backend contains extensive e-commerce functionality including advanced analytics, loyalty programs, A/B testing, multi-language support, vendor management, advanced search, reporting systems, and comprehensive business logic that needs to be preserved and enhanced within our full-stack architecture.
