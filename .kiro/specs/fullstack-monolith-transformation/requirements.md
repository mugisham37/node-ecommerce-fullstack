# Full-Stack Monolith Architecture Transformation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive transformation of the existing e-commerce inventory management system from a fragmented Spring Boot API with basic Next.js starter into a production-ready, enterprise-grade full-stack monolith architecture. The transformation will create a unified, scalable, and maintainable system capable of serving millions of users with modern development and deployment practices.

The current system has a well-developed Spring Boot API with comprehensive business logic, but lacks proper frontend applications, shared packages, unified communication layers, and production-ready infrastructure. This transformation will address these gaps while preserving existing functionality and enhancing the overall architecture.
