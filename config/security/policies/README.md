## Implementation

### Application Integration
These policies are implemented in the application through:

1. **Authentication Service** (`apps/api/src/auth/`)
   - Password validation using password-policy.json
   - Role-based access control using access-control-policy.json
   - Session management and MFA enforcement

2. **Data Layer** (`packages/database/`)
   - Field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Data classification and retention enforcement
   - Audit logging for data access

3. **Monitoring** (`apps/api/src/monitoring/`)
   - Security event detection and alerting
   - Incident response automation
   - Compliance reporting

### Configuration Management
- Policies are loaded at application startup
- Changes require application restart or hot-reload
- Policy violations are logged and monitored
- Regular policy reviews and updates
